 NOTE:
 If you need to create mixed elements (that is, elements with intermingled
 text and child elements, such as <parent>Some text<child>Child
 text</child>More text</parent>) then you can use a special mkp notation.4
 Use mkp.yield normally and mkp.yieldUnescaped if you want to bypass
 escaping of special symbols like the ampersand, less-than, and greater-than
 characters, which are normally escaped and replaced with their equivalent
 HTML encoding.

 mkp is short for markup but the abbreviation isnâ€™t likely to conflict with a name you might want to use in your
 created content.
